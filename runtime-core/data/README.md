Canonical distance fields used by visual metrics tests.

Files:
- mandelbrot_distance_1024.npy
- mandelbrot_distance_1024.json

These are precomputed signed distance fields used for deterministic testing and runtime sampling. If you update these files, ensure the accompanying .json metadata is correct (xmin/xmax/ymin/ymax/res).
